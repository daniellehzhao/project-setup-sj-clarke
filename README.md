## Project Vision Statement 

This project idea sparked when our group was brainstorming project ideas and started thinking of tedious tasks in our lives that could be less tedious with the use of technology. We began to discuss how hard it can b to keep track of how much money you owe people and who owes you money when you are participating in a lot of transactions during a vacation or actvity with a group of people. It can be frustrating if you do not get all the money back that you spent covering other people at dinner or other events. This inspired us to propose the idea of TripSplit, a web application that makes splitting expenses during vacations, events, or day to day activities easy to keep track of and less tedious. We want to elimite the stress and frustration associated with this process and make our users lifes easier. 

Once on the TripSplit web application, users will be able to create a group, which they can add friends who also have TripSplit accounts to. Once a trip is created, all users who have access to this trip can create expenses. When a trip is first created, each member of the group will have 0 balances due. However, when payments begin to be created and split between members of the group, balances will be created for each person within the group that the user owes money to. For example, if I was on a trip with 5 my friends and one person named Sarah covered dinner for $500. After dinner Sarah will create this expense on her TripSplit account within the TripSplit group, input $500 as the total payment, add all 4 of us to the payment, and once the payment has been created, under our balances we will see a new entry that says we owe Sarah $100. These balances will constantly be updated as new payments are created or even deleted throughout the trip. 

## MVP
The current goals for our web application are the basic ability for users to: 
- Make a group 
- Add friends to a group 
- View all transactions between members of a group
- Create an expense and charge friends within your group 
- Keep track of your balance, how much money you owe each memebr of the group, and how much money other members of the group owe you for the current group 
- View all recent transactions within a group 
- Add friends 
- Manage account (username, first name, last name, email, profile picture)

Functionalities that will be nice to have: 
- Full user functionality
